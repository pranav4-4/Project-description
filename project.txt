A Crowed detector(A geofencer or locator):

This is the project I most recently worked on. It is based on flutter and dart. It's a location tracker in which I will provide a constant coordinates i.e latitude and longitude of a particular place example a 
hotel or restaurant after that it will access the location of the individual around that coordinate who is using my app around x meter(developer will specify by his/her choice) of radius and then count the no. of users using my app
around that coordinate and print it on my screen.

Motive of making this project is that during covid, their were guidelines to have limited people in the restaurant but illegally they were having more customers than specified limit so
it took me to build this small prototype.
